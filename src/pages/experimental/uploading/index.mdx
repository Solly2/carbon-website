## Things to consider

- Is the action uploading or is it importing?
- Where is the upload action performed?
- How many items will the user need to upload at any one time? The UI shell is designed to be configurable. A product or platform can choose which shell components and configurations to use, based on their user and information requirements.

## Overview

The action of uploading should always be the result of a user action.
The action of uploading a file could be done by selecting an action button
to open a modal or it may be done inline in a full page form or slide in or
over panel.

## Upload methods

- Drag and Drop
- Choose a file

Wherever possible there should always be a drag and drop zone, using the file
drop component, as well as the ability to browse locally and select a file.
Note that file selection should be restricted to only allowed file types.

After the files have been dropped into the field, they should be entered info

have uploaded and the status of that process.

<br />

If the user is required to input details about the files being uploaded then
the files should be displayed in cards underneath the drop zone, with the
fields to be completed on them.

Upload errors can be displayed inline in this view.
